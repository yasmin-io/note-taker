# Note Taker

Note taking apps are my go-to way for jotting down those fleeting important thoughts. I wanted to build a website to help other people like myself, allowing users to write down notes whenever needed. Note Taker uses Node.js, Express to build the functionality and Heroku to deploy both the front and back end which is available for you to use.

## How it Works?

---

```
Step by step guide through the application:

- When you first open then app, you are greeted with the Notetaker homepage.

- Then click the 'Get Started' button. You will then be presented to the Note Taker 'Notes page'.

- You can click on Note Title or Note Text to provide the information you want to be stored.

- When you are finish, click the save icon in the top right to save your note.

- Then your note should appear on the notes sidebar.

- Finally, If you want to delete a note you can by clicking the trash can option next to each note.

```
